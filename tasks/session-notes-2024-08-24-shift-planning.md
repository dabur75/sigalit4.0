- [x] Document all technical requirements and timeline

## üìã Pre-Session Checklist
- [x] Read `SESSION_STARTUP.md`
- [x] Read `PROJECT.md` for current status
- [x] Check `tasks/README.md` for task status
- [x] Understand workflow requirements
- [x] Have approved plan (if starting new feature)

## üöÄ What I Accomplished

### Features Implemented
- Comprehensive shift dashboard planning document created
- Flexible weekly schedule architecture designed
- One-time override system planned
- Integration with existing house-based system designed

### Files Modified
- `tasks/planned/PLAN-006-shift-dashboard.md` - New comprehensive planning document
- `tasks/README.md` - Updated with new planned task

### Files Created
- `tasks/planned/PLAN-006-shift-dashboard.md` - Complete planning document
- `tasks/session-notes-2024-08-24-shift-planning.md` - This session notes document

### Issues Resolved
- Clarified relationship between weekly schedule and daily schedule
- Designed override system for unexpected events
- Planned integration with existing crew management system

## üìö What I Learned

### Technical Insights
- Weekly schedule needs to be house-based for proper isolation
- Override system requires careful date handling and conflict resolution
- Daily schedule calculation must combine regular + override data efficiently

### Workflow Lessons
- Planning phase is crucial for complex features like this
- Stakeholder approval needed before development begins
- Comprehensive documentation saves time in long-term

### Hebrew RTL Considerations
- Schedule components must support Hebrew text and RTL layout
- Date pickers need Hebrew localization
- Activity types and instructor names in Hebrew

## üö® Issues Encountered

### Problems Faced
- Complex schedule calculation logic requires careful planning
- Multiple component integration needs proper state management strategy
- Database design for overrides needs to handle conflicts

### Solutions Implemented
- Designed flexible database schema supporting both regular and override schedules
- Planned React Query for efficient state management
- Designed component architecture for independent development and testing

### Known Limitations
- Override system complexity may require iterative development
- Schedule calculation performance needs optimization for large datasets

### Blocking Issues
- **STOPPED**: Awaiting stakeholder approval of planning document
- Cannot proceed to development phase without approval
