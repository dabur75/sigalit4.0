- As a GUIDE, I want to view daily schedules for my house so that I know what activities are planned
- As a COORDINATOR, I want to manage shift tasks so that daily operations run smoothly
- As a COORDINATOR, I want to handle medical referrals so that patient care is properly managed
- As a COORDINATOR, I want to manage shift instructors so that proper staffing is maintained
- As a staff member, I want to send internal messages so that I can communicate with my team
